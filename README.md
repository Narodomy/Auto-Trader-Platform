# Auto Trader Platform (System Analysis Project)

This repository contains the project files for the Auto Trader Platform, a project developed as part of the System Analysis (SA) class during my Bachelor's degree at King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok (KMUTNB). This project was a collaborative effort with a partner.

## Project Overview

The Auto Trader Platform was designed as a proof-of-concept for an automated trading system. The project focused on applying system analysis methodologies to define, design, and plan the development of a trading platform that could execute trades based on predefined strategies.

## Key Aspects

* **System Analysis and Design:**
    * We conducted a thorough analysis of the requirements for an auto trading system.
    * We developed use cases, data flow diagrams, and entity-relationship diagrams to model the system.
    * We created a detailed system design document outlining the architecture and components of the platform.
* **Data Handling:**
    * We addressed the requirements for handling market data, including data retrieval, storage, and analysis.
* **Partner Collaboration:**
    * This project was a collaborative effort, requiring effective communication and teamwork.

## Acknowledgments

## Note

This project was developed as part of an academic course and may not be suitable for production use without further development and security audits.
